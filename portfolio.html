          <p>
            Hello! My name is Nate Simon, and I am a senior at Portland State
            University pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My hobbies include
            recreational reading and hanging out with my dog, Kira. My favorite
            genre of books is sci-fi/fantasy, unfortunately nonfiction just
            can't compete with Middle Earth and the like. My dog is a German
            Shepard and Husky mix, I like the idea of all my possessions being
            covered in dog hair so I made sure to get this breed mix for her
            fantastic shedding capacity. In addition to providing some
            background on me personally, this website also serves as a showcase
            of my portfolio by featuring my projects, professional experience,
            and contact information. Thank you for visiting!
          </p>

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>
              My academic journey has been enriched by extensive professional
              experience gained during breaks from school. I began my career as
              a contracted aviation electrician, which led me to the
              semiconductor field, where I worked as both a technician and an
              engineer. Although a large part of these jobs entailed working
              with my hands, I developed my troubleshooting and problem-solving
              skills, which have helped me tremendously in my pursuit of higher
              education. I have also been working at a comapny called Cordiance,
              an software compnay that specializes in indirect tax and automated
              tax solutions. My tenure there started as a summer internship, but
              has grown into a part-time position while I finsih my schooling.
              This has been a fantastic learning experience and I look forward
              to contributing further to this great company.
