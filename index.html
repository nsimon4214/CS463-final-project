          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Nate Simon, and I am a senior at Portland State
            University pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My academic journey has been enriched by extensive professional
            experience gained during breaks from school. I began my career as
            a contracted aviation electrician, which led me to the
            semiconductor field, where I worked as both a technician and an
            engineer. Although a large part of these jobs entailed working
            with my hands, I developed my troubleshooting and problem-solving
            skills, which have helped me tremendously in my pursuit of higher
            education. I have also been working at a comapny called Cordiance,
            an software compnay that specializes in indirect tax and automated
            tax solutions. My tenure there started as a summer internship, but
            has grown into a part-time position while I finsih my schooling.
            This has been a fantastic learning experience and I look forward
            to contributing further to this great company.
          </p>

          <h3>Random Interval Timer</h3>
          <p>
            The <strong>Random Interval Timer</strong> is a Python-based
            application designed to bring variety to your workouts or training
            routines. With customizable minimum and maximum intervals, this
            timer generates random durations to guide your exercises, rest
            periods, or other timed activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Use Case Example:</strong> Set the timer to select intervals
            between 60 and 120 seconds. Start the session and perform exercises
            like pushups for 78 seconds, situps for 99 seconds, and squats for
            102 seconds, followed by a rest for 68 seconds.
          </p>
          <h3>Features:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Customizable time intervals.</li>
            <li>
              Audio notifications to signal the start and end of each interval.
            </li>
            <li>Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).</li>
            <li>Built with Python, featuring a user-friendly GUI.</li>
