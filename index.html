      <p>
        Hello! My name is Nate Simon, and I’m a senior at Portland State
        University pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My hobbies include
        recreational reading and hanging out with my dog, Kira. My favorite
        genre of books is sci-fi/fantasy, unfortunately nonfiction just can't
        compete with Middle Earth and the like. My dog is a German Shepard and
        Husky mix, I like the idea of all my possessions being covered in dog
        hair so I made sure to get this breed mix for her fantastic shedding
        capacity. In addition to providing some background on me personally, this website also
        serves as a showcase of my portfolio by featuring my projects, professional
        experience, and contact information. Thank you for visiting!
      </p>
      <section id="prev_exp"><h2>Previous Work Experience</h2></section>
      <p>My academic journey has been enriched by extensive professional experience gained during
        breaks from school. I began my career as an contracted aviation
        electrician, which led me to the semiconductor field, where I worked as
        both a technician and an engineer. These roles honed my troubleshooting
        and problem-solving abilities—skills that have been invaluable
        throughout my studies and projects in Computer Science.</p>
